# Bioinformatics Workshop

## Get Your Copy
Welcome to the R workshop files. Please download a copy of this "repository" by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/tethig/revanent/archive/master.zip) (or click on "Code" above and select "Download ZIP"). This will download a copy of a folder called "revanent-master.zip" on your computer. Extract the contents of this folder onto a folder on your computer and open up the PPTX file to follow along.

## Installing on your Own Computer?
If you have your own computer it is easy to install R. You can do so via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; choose a [local mirror site here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)). Mac users can do this or, if you feel like being ridiculously up to date, you can find nightly MacOS builds on [this bleeding-edge repository](https://mac.r-project.org/). In this workshop we will be installing and using [RStudio Desktop, Open Source Edition](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/). If you are a power user and you want to do some additional things with R, you may find my [tips and tricks repository](https://github.com/tethig/turbo-spoon) helpful.
